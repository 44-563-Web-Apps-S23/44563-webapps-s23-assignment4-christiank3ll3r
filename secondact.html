<h3> The Gazing Globe by Eugene Pillot</h3>

    <h3>ZAMA.</h3>
    <p> And now the crowd do be parting--he leaves the boat and he
looks this way, Ohano--he looks!</p>
    <h3>OHANO.</h3>
    <p> Nijo, my red wonder of the world!</p>
    <h3>ZAMA.</h3>
    <p> See, he mounts his steed--he waves to you!</p>
    <h3>OHANO.</h3>
    <p> Nijo! Nijo! </p>
